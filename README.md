# Godot Pomodoro Timer

Simple pomodoro timer with messages and sound notifications used to improve your time studying using http://www.godotengine.org/  

With very simple configuration you can use this pomtimer right away, the default time is 25 minutes for the full pomodoro and 5 minutes for a break, but you can change this with the menu options, this will only modify it for this session

# How to use it

You just have to open this with Godot and export it to your desired system, Ive only tested it with windows but there shouldnt be any issue with other formats, make sure you downloaded the export templates from the same page you downloaded the engine

As simple as that, you can run it with F5 on Godot if you dont feel like exporting it

# Disclaimer

The code might be a mess, I tried to comment it a bit but I think its pretty simple to understand, the naming system is also a mess because this all started as me messing around with the engine. Feel free to contribute, ask, open issues, whatever you like, godot is a great engine it needs more people using it
